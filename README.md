# PROJECT NAME: WTWR - Backend Server

##

### **`DESCRIPTION:`**

### This project is the backend server for the WTWR application previously designed and posted [here](https://bigredcoding.github.io/se_project_react/). At it's current stage, it has the baseline logic to handle requests and store data at a targeted server. Future modifications will combine the projects to produce a fully functional front-and-back-end application.

================================================================================================

### **`TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES:`**

### This server was created using mainly Javascript. Other functionality add-ons include Mongoose, ESLint, Nodemon, Express, and Modules. With the assistance of the software Postman and MongoDB, functionalities were able to be verified and the database was able to be created and managed. Currently, if a person wanted to test this themselves, it it configured to run off of localhost:27017 with a wtwr folder.
